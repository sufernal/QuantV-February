|:------------- |
Current february version is QuantV 3.0.0, and will be published when is finished but in the mean time a lot of cool ideas arised and started working on too many and too complex effects so development is getting slower than expected so please be patient.
Because of that, early access of QV3 beta builds will be available in Discord for people who want to support the development process in order to get quality feedback and update current effects so they don't get outdated for the final version.
